## Description

Trackd is an ALL-in-One hobbyist/collector app where you are able to track the books, CDs, albums, puzzles, and everything else you might know. Is there a hobby that there is no way to track besides your notes? Trackd is here to help! With our customizable UI allowing you to make your own categories and metrics for each hobby. There will also be overall statistics for each hobby to track numbers like price! Future development will allow you to share with friends and join communities of similar hobbies.
