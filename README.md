## Description

Trackd is an ALL-in-One hobbyist/collector app where you are able to track the books, CDs, albums, puzzles, and everything else you might know. Is there a hobby that there is no way to track besides your notes? Trackd is here to help! With our customizable UI allowing you to make your own categories and metrics for each hobby. There will also be overall statistics for each hobby to track numbers like price! Future development will allow you to share with friends and join communities of similar hobbies.

## Usage

The usage of this application is simple. The user has to first make an account using their email and an username and password, of their choice. The user can create posts about books that they read. They can also update and delete, only their own posts. The user can also view a certain user's post, by clicking on their name link. And go to their home feed to see what everyone else has been reading.
